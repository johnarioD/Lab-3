## Answer 1:
_Leakage_ and _Dynamic Power Consumption_ are both contributing factors to a CPU's total energy/power consumption. They, along with any _Short-Circuit Power Consumption_ define the overall energy needs of a processor. Nowadays, _Short-Circuit Power Consumption_ is ignored as it is relatively small and can be considered as part of the dynamic power consumption.  
  
Dynamic Power Consumption, specifically is the power required by the capacitors of the logic gates within the CPU. It is generally calculated as **_Pdyn = a*Î£(Ci*Vdd^2*f)_** where _Ci_ is the capacity of the individual capacitors that changed state, **_f_** is the frequency and and **_Vdd_** is the supply voltage and **_a_** is a switching factor (it represents the percentage of gates that actually switch within a clock cycle). A more accurate formula would be **_Pdyn = a*f*(ci*li+hi*ki*Co)*Vdd^2_**  
  
Leakage power is the static "leakage" of power through components normally percieved as insulating, such as a diode or any gradual losses from components such as charged capacitors. This type of power consumption is usually separated into two different categories: Subthreshold leakage and gate leakage. The first of the two refers to currents that continue to exist in components that are in their cutoff regions while the second refers to currents passing through the gate's oxides. Its value is **_Ple = hi*ki*Vdd*(Isub+Ig)_**  
  
Dynamic power consumption is going to increase in a "per program" basis and should scale more with the amount of the CPU operations than the actual time it takes for them to happen, of course, longer programs usually gave more instructions/operations so it would be expected that program execution time also indirectly affects this metric. Leakage is a more static power draining component which should only be related to CPU usage duration rather than instruction count.

When dealing with the problem of optimizing power usage for a 40Watt battery compared to a 4Watt battery we should consider the following methods:  
- Firstly, we could reduce the leakages to such a degree that they are incocequncial. Supposing that our 4Watt CPU has 9 times as much leakage as its dynamic power consuption this could indeed make the 40Watt CPU better (of course this is a very unrealistic scenario and we have a comment about it after the other methods have been explained)  
- Second, we could improve the 40Watt's CPU CPI while ensuring that leakages are on a similar scale on both processors. This way the what processor would have to operate for a lot fewer clock cycles thus draining a lot less "Dynamic Power". (This approach is slightly more realistic as we saw in the last lab that CPI can be reduced greatly depending on the architecture)  
- Lastly, we could improve overall speed of execution for the program while minimizing the leakages. In this case it doesn't necessarily have to specfically a CPI reduction as it could also be a clock speed increase or other technique. As long as the total required power remains at 40Watt the speed improvement may reduce the overall power usage of the CPU.  
  
Of course, we realize, the perfect answer lies somewhere inbetween the previous methods with a minimization of leakages and a program execution speedup. The methods we proposed, are somewhat unrealistic on their own but work multiplicatively thus we consider that result possible to achieve (despite it being difficult to do so).
